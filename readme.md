# DecreaseOnly

Very simple program to decrease image files.
Formats: jpg, jpeg, bmp, tiff, png.

If you choose _'recursive'_ it will look for images in subdirectories.
Choose filetypes to decrease and desired resolution.
Decreasing will be made on the longest size.
If both image sizes smaller than chosen, nothing will be done.
A new folder will be created in the same location as the original one (keeping directory structure in case of recursion).
**WARNING**: If you choose _'overwrite files'_ all files will be overwritten without the possibility of recovery!
Errors will be displayed in the log section.
Enjoy!
